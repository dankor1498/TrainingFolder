The names of the letters are 
rarely spelled out, except 
when used in derivations 
or compound words (for 
example tee-shirt, deejay, 
emcee, okay, aitchless, etc.), 
derived forms (for example 
exed out, effing, to eff 
and blind, etc.), and in 
the names of objects named 
after letters (for example 
em (space) in printing and 
wye (junction) in railroading). 
The forms listed below are from 
the Oxford English Dictionary. 
Vowels stand for themselves, 
and consonants usually have 
the form consonant + ee or e 
+ consonant (e.g. bee and ef). 
The exceptions are the letters 
aitch, jay, kay, cue, ar, ess 
(but es- in compounds ), double 
u, wye, and zed. Plurals of 
consonants end in -s (bees, 
efs, ems) or, in the cases 
of aitch, ess, and ex, in -es 
(aitches, esses, exes). Plurals 
of vowels end in -es (aes, ees, 
ies, oes, ues); these are rare. 
All letters may stand for themselves, 
generally in capitalized form 
(okay or OK, emcee or MC), and 
plurals may be based on these 
(aes or As, cees or Cs, etc.)
