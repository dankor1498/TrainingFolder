Develop a program to calculate the total number of kilocalories (kcal) in food consumed.
A piece of food consists of:

  ·Protein, 4.1 kcal/g

  ·Fats, 9.3 kcal/g

  ·Carbohydrates, 4.1 kcal/g

Input:
1. An array of integers, where consecutive groups of four numbers contain the information about food products:
  1.1 Unique ID.
  1.2 Protein content per one gram.
  1.3 Fat content per one gram.
  1.4 Carbohydrate content per one gram.
2. Termination number -1.
3. An array of integers, where consecutive groups of two numbers contain the information about food products consumed:
  3.1 ID.
  3.2 Amount in grams.
Note: If there are several entries for the same product, then corresponding amounts are summed for that product.
4. Termination number -1.

Output:
A real number, the total amount of kilocalories in the food consumed.
